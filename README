The first thing I want to test is using GitHub's pull request API.

So, I'll create this file, then ask someone else to:
1 - fork the project
2 - make a commit (or more) to their fork
3 - create a pull request

Then I will:
1 - test the pull request API to see the pull request listed
2 - manually pull the commit from their repo using info I see in the API response
3 - push this to my repo
4 - look at my open pull requests (on web UI and API) to see if GH closed the pull request automagically
